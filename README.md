Internal Tool of Mushroom Edibility Feature Project

Welcome to the mushroom edibility Project! This project has all necessary data
that serves as a proof of concept for the proposed feature within the HikingPal App.
The app uses a [mushroom dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification) that will be used as the base
of a trained machine-learning model. Using the model we'll be able to predict if the
is edible or not.
